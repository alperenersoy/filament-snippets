# Filament Snippets for Visual Studio Code

This extension contains VS Code snippets for Filament Admin Panel, Form Builder, Table Builder and Notifications packages.

## Installation

Search and install from VS Code Extension Panel. If you can't find the extension panel please launch the command palette (Ctrl + Shift + P or Cmd + Shift + P) and type 'Install Extensions'.

## Usage

You can either start with the context (e.g. inputselect or columntext) or vice versa (e.g. selectinput or textcolumn). For some of the components you can directly use the component name (e.g. select or toggle).

You can also use only capital letters of the snippet for short (e.g. ct instead of columntext or is instead of inputselect).
